#Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of setting up a new UberFire application. Starting from an empty directory, we will create a simple TOD-DO list or "Task Manager". In the process we will explain most of the Uberfire components and concepts required to build a moderately complex application.

When we're done, we will have an application that looks something like this:

The left panel contains the Projects screen which contains a list of projects to be worked on. The "New Project" button is used to create new Project items.

The main panel contains the Tasks screen which lists all of the TO-DO list items for the currently selected Project. Tasks are grouped by topics, which we call "Folders" (the "Tutorial" and "Archetype" headings); they have a name and checkbox to indicate that they have been completed. The "New Folder" button is used to create new topics or Folders. New Tasks are created by simply entering a Task description in the text field and pressing the ENTER key.
